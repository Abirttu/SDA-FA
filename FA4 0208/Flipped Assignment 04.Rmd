#Constant variance check: Residual vs. fitted value plot shows random scatter
# which indicates that variance is constant.
# Normality Check: From the Normal Q-Q plot we can see that the error is normally
# distributed
# from the fitted values vs. sqrt(standardized residuals) plot we see that all
# the data points distance between them is not too higher and within the value 
# 1.5 so it seems that there will be no outliers

# Answer to the ques no. e

# From the summary of the model, we see that abs value of t is 1.624 which is less
# than the value of t[alpha/2,n-2] which is 2.624 hence the regression is not 
# significant
